# ELEC3300 - Introduction to Embedded Systems

## Course Description

This course is designed to teach techniques on how to integrate machine-level software and hardware in ARM-core microcontroller based systems. It makes use of industry-standard techniques and technologies, from which students can interface, design and program microcontroller systems. The task of the course will be to complete five laboratory experiments which address different aspects of hardware/software interfacing, and one large microprocessor/microcontroller based project which should result in the design and implementation of a small working embedded system.

Prerequisite(s): COMP 2611 OR ELEC 2300 OR ELEC 2350 OR ISDN 4000F

## Our Project

Our project is to develop a robotic page turner device for either musicians or people with disabilities.

For musicians, music sheets usually have more than two pages, but the size of a common sheet stand cannot fit more than two pages simultaneously. Without other external tools, musicians have to either find someone else to flip the pages for them, or need to free up one hand to turn the pages during performance, at the cost of briefly pausing for one hand.

On the other hand, people who have motor neuron diseases, like cerebral palsy, cannot control their arm movement properly. Actions that require motor control, like turning a page of a book, become tedious for them.

Therefore, we want to develop a robotic page turner controlled by tapping of the foot as seldom instrument requires all four limbs, and it does not require fine motor controls.
We would add metal clips to the corners of each page of the book, then build a robotic arm with electromagnets to flip the music script controlled by a motor. The arm will use magnetic force to pick a single page and flip over. We will implement a foot pedal for signal input. 

The role of the microcontroller will be controlling the motor turning direction and signal receiving/processing.
